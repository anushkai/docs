## Inference Graphs

Ignotus's Inference Graph system is a powerful DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) execution engine designed to help users accomplish complex tasks through step-by-step, LLM-guided workflows.

### What are Inference Graphs?

Inference Graphs are dynamic workflows that can evolve at runtime based on LLM decisions. The system combines graph-based computation with dynamic node generation to create adaptive, intelligent workflows that can handle complex tasks automatically.

### How Inference Graphs Work

#### 1. Dynamic Graph Generation
The LLM creates workflows automatically based on your request:

1. **Initial Prompt**: You provide a simple request like "fill the PDF form"
2. **LLM Analysis**: The system determines what operations are needed
3. **Node Creation**: LLM creates initial nodes (extractors, processors, etc.)
4. **Execution**: Nodes execute and produce outputs
5. **Iterative Generation**: LLM creates new nodes based on current outputs
6. **Completion**: Workflow completes when no more processing is needed

#### 2. Operator Types

**Source Operators** (No Inputs):
- `const_text`: Provides constant text output
- `get_user_personal_details`: Retrieves user profile information
- `acrobat_current_pdf_text_extractor`: Extracts text from current PDF
- `acrobat_current_pdf_form_field_extractor`: Extracts form fields from PDF
- `get_all_available_window_descs`: Gets all open window information

**Processing Operators**:
- `llm_query`: Performs LLM queries with various models
- `text_prompt`: Prompts user for input
- `graph_node_generator`: Generates new nodes based on current state

**Sink Operators** (No Outputs):
- `acrobat_current_pdf_form_field_filler`: Fills form fields in PDF
- `show_result_to_user`: Displays result to user
- `capture_screenshot_of_window`: Captures screenshot of specified window

### PDF Form Processing Example

When you click the "Fill form" pill action:

#### Step 1: Initial Generation
The LLM creates initial nodes:
- `acrobat_current_pdf_form_field_extractor` (understand what fields exist)
- `acrobat_current_pdf_text_extractor` (get document context)
- `get_user_personal_details` (get user's information)

#### Step 2: Execution
These nodes execute, producing live outputs:
- Form field structure and types
- Document content and context
- User personal information

#### Step 3: Processing Generation
LLM creates processing nodes:
- `llm_query` node that takes all outputs as input
- Uses structured output schema for form filling

#### Step 4: Final Generation
LLM creates sink node:
- `acrobat_current_pdf_form_field_filler` to actually fill the form

#### Result
A complete 6-node workflow created automatically from a single click!

### Real-time Action Descriptions

Each operator provides real-time feedback through action descriptions:

#### Action Description System
- **Real-time Status**: Shows current operator action in the UI
- **Icon System**: Visual icons for different operation types:
  - üëÅÔ∏è **Eye**: Data extraction operations (PDF, form fields, user details)
  - üß† **Brain**: LLM processing and generation
  - ‚úèÔ∏è **Pencil**: Data modification/filling operations
  - üì∑ **Camera**: Screenshot and capture operations
  - üî§ **Text**: Simple text processing
  - ‚öôÔ∏è **Gear**: General processing operations

#### Minimum Execution Time
- Configurable delay (default: 0.25s) ensures users see action descriptions
- Smooth fade in/out transitions for better UX

### Available Models

The `llm_query` operator supports multiple Google Gemini models:

- **extra light**: `gemini-1.5-flash-lite` - Fastest, basic tasks
- **light**: `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` - Balanced speed and quality
- **medium**: `gemini-1.5-flash` - Good quality for most tasks
- **good**: `gemini-2.0-flash` - High quality processing
- **pro**: `gemini-2.5-flash` - Best quality for complex tasks

### Structured Output

The system automatically uses structured output for better results:
- **Input Schema**: Each operator defines its expected input format
- **Structured JSON**: LLM outputs are automatically formatted
- **Type Safety**: Ensures data flows correctly between nodes
- **Error Prevention**: Reduces errors in complex workflows

### Pill Action Integration

Inference graphs are fully integrated with the main application's pill action system:

#### Context Detection
- App detects PDF context with form fields
- Automatically creates relevant pills based on context
- Zero-configuration execution

#### Smart Pill Creation
When a PDF with form fields is detected:
- **"Fill form" Pill**: Dynamic LLM-driven workflow
- **"Clear form" Pill**: Direct AppleScript execution
- **"Extract info" Pill**: Information extraction workflow

### Advanced Features

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Graceful degradation when operations fail
- Detailed error messages and recovery options

#### Serialization Support
- Save and load graphs as JSON
- Export workflows for reuse
- Share workflows between users

#### Topological Execution
- Ensures proper dependency resolution
- Prevents circular dependencies
- Optimizes execution order

### Configuration

#### Minimum Execution Time
```swift
// In AppConfig.swift
var minimumOperatorExecutionTime: TimeInterval = 0.25
```

#### Model Selection
Choose your preferred model based on task complexity:
- **Simple tasks**: Use "light" or "extra light" for speed
- **Complex analysis**: Use "pro" for best quality
- **Balanced approach**: Use "medium" or "good" for most tasks

### Troubleshooting

**Graph not generating?**
- Check that your API key is correctly configured
- Ensure you have an active internet connection
- Verify the initial prompt is clear and specific

**Execution errors?**
- Check that required applications are running (Adobe Acrobat Pro)
- Verify permissions are granted for screen recording
- Review the error logs for specific issues

**Performance issues?**
- Use lighter models for faster execution
- Reduce minimum execution time for quicker feedback
- Close other resource-intensive applications
