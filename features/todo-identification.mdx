### What is To-Do Identification?

To-Do Identification is Ignotus's intelligent system that continuously monitors your conversations and applications to automatically identify tasks, action items, and responsibilities that require your attention. It transforms scattered information into organized, actionable tasks.

### How To-Do Identification Works

#### Continuous Monitoring
The system operates by:
- **Conversation Analysis**: Monitors email threads and messaging apps
- **Content Scanning**: Analyzes documents and web pages
- **Context Understanding**: Identifies tasks based on your role and responsibilities
- **Smart Categorization**: Organizes tasks by priority and type

#### Intelligent Task Detection
Ignotus uses advanced AI to:
- **Extract Action Items**: Identify specific tasks from conversations
- **Determine Priority**: Assess urgency and importance
- **Set Due Dates**: Extract or suggest appropriate deadlines
- **Assign Context**: Associate tasks with relevant projects
