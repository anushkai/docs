### What is Cross-App Understanding?

Cross-App Understanding is Ignotus's ability to track and manage your work across different applications, automatically associating windows with projects and maintaining context as you switch between tools. This feature ensures that your AI assistant understands your workflow regardless of which application you're currently using.

### How Cross-App Understanding Works

#### Window Association
Ignotus automatically:
- **Tracks Active Windows**: Monitors which applications you're using
- **Associates with Projects**: Links windows to specific projects
- **Maintains Context**: Preserves context when switching between apps
- **Smart Grouping**: Groups related windows under the same project

#### Project Management
The system manages your work through:
- **Project Creation**: Automatically creates projects for new work
- **Window Assignment**: Associates windows with appropriate projects
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains project context across app switches
- **Workflow Continuity**: Ensures seamless transitions between tools
