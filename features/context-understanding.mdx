### What is Context Understanding?

Context Understanding is Ignotus's ability to analyze your current work situation and provide relevant assistance without you having to explicitly explain what you're doing. The system continuously monitors your desktop activity and adapts its responses based on your current context.

- **Temporal Context**: Time of day and work patterns

#### Context-Aware Responses
Based on the analyzed context, Ignotus provides:
- **Relevant Suggestions**: Help that matches your current task
- **Proactive Assistance**: Solutions before you ask for them
