### What are Knowledge DBs?

Knowledge DBs are Ignotus's intelligent knowledge management system that allows you to store, organize, and retrieve information. This creates a searchable knowledge base that grows with your work and provides instant access to relevant information.

### How Knowledge DBs Work


#### Knowledge Organization
Ignotus automatically:
- **Chunks Content**: Breaks documents into manageable pieces
- **Indexes Information**: Makes content searchable and retrievable
- **Maintains Context**: Preserves relationships between information
