### What are Knowledge DBs?

Knowledge DBs are Ignotus's intelligent knowledge management system that allows you to store, organize, and retrieve information using ChromaDB's vector database technology. This creates a searchable knowledge base that grows with your work and provides instant access to relevant information.

### How Knowledge DBs Work

#### Vector Database Technology
The system uses:
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Advanced vector database for semantic search
- **Text Embeddings**: Converts text into searchable vector representations
- **Semantic Search**: Finds information based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Returns relevant information based on current context

#### Knowledge Organization
Ignotus automatically:
- **Chunks Content**: Breaks documents into manageable pieces
- **Creates Embeddings**: Generates vector representations of text
- **Indexes Information**: Makes content searchable and retrievable
- **Maintains Context**: Preserves relationships between information

- **Reference Materials**: Guides, tutorials, and how-to content

### ChromaDB Integration

#### Vector Database Technology
ChromaDB provides:
- **Semantic Search**: Find information based on meaning
- **Fast Retrieval**: Quick access to relevant information
- **Scalable Storage**: Handle large amounts of knowledge
- **Real-time Updates**: Add new information instantly

#### Embedding Generation
The system creates:
- **Text Embeddings**: Vector representations of text content
- **Semantic Understanding**: Captures meaning and relationships
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains context within chunks
- **Search Optimization**: Optimizes for relevant retrieval

### Knowledge Management Features

#### Automatic Processing
Ignotus automatically:
- **Chunks Documents**: Breaks large documents into searchable pieces
- **Generates Embeddings**: Creates vector representations
- **Indexes Content**: Makes information searchable
- **Maintains Metadata**: Preserves source and context information

#### Smart Organization
The system organizes knowledge by:
- **Content Type**: Documents, conversations, notes, etc.
- **Source Application**: Which app the information came from
- **Project Association**: Links to relevant projects
- **Temporal Context**: When the information was created
- **Relevance Score**: How relevant to current context

### Query and Retrieval

#### Semantic Search
Find information using:
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English
- **Context-Aware Search**: Results based on current work context
- **Relevance Ranking**: Most relevant results appear first
- **Source Attribution**: See where information came from

#### Advanced Queries
The system supports:
- **Complex Questions**: Multi-part queries and follow-ups
- **Contextual Search**: Find information related to current task
- **Project-Specific Queries**: Search within specific projects
- **Temporal Queries**: Find information from specific time periods

### Integration with Other Features

#### Context Understanding
Knowledge DBs work with:
- **Current Context**: Retrieves information relevant to your current work
- **Application Context**: Understands which app you're using
- **Project Context**: Associates knowledge with specific projects
- **Workflow Context**: Considers your current task and goals

#### Cross-App Understanding
The system can:
- **Cross-Reference Information**: Connect knowledge across applications
- **Provide Context**: Add relevant information to current work
- **Suggest Resources**: Recommend related documents and information
- **Maintain Connections**: Preserve relationships between information

### Knowledge Growth and Learning

#### Continuous Learning
The system improves by:
- **Usage Patterns**: Learning from how you search and retrieve information
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporating your feedback on search results
- **Context Learning**: Understanding what information is most relevant
- **Query Optimization**: Improving search based on your preferences

#### Knowledge Evolution
Your knowledge base:
- **Grows Over Time**: Accumulates more information and context
- **Improves Accuracy**: Better search results as it learns
- **Adapts to You**: Tailors to your work patterns and preferences
- **Maintains Relevance**: Keeps information current and useful

### Privacy & Security

<Note>
Knowledge DBs store information locally on your device using ChromaDB. Your knowledge base is never uploaded to external servers unless you explicitly choose to share specific information for analysis.
</Note>
